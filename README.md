# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course work. 

# <# Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation to creating this study guide was to show others that, even if you dont know how to do something it
is possible, you just have to get up and try and not give up. I built this project to show myself and others, information of different coding languages. The problem I solved was trying something new and learning alot out of it. I learned that coding is hard and that I still dont know anything, but I'm going to keep trying and not stop learning.
